This is another project which was created as part of OdinProject - Javascript classes.

The main goal of this project was to have as little global code as possible. Tried tucking everything away inside of a Module or Factory Functions. That was a hard project, It works well (full functionality) but I am not happy about coding. I don't think that it was coded clean and dry. 

The main reason, I don't have a command of these subjects (modules, factories) related to object oriented programming. Mostly I coded this project by trial and error and this caused complicated codes. Moreover, still I don't feel good about these subjects. I gotta focus on them more ! 

If you determine any error or if you have any advice, Please let me know. 
I pay attention so much to your opinion and suggestion.
